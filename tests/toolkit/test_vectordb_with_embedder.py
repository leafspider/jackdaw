For example, the climbs Larry and Curly at Old Baldy. Are people building gear anchors at the top of the climb and then cleaning the route, disassembling the anchor, and walking off? If there are no features other than trees on the top of the cliff it seems like disassembling the anchor would be difficult and dangerous, and I cannot imagine doing this. Apologies if I am missing some obvious here."""
